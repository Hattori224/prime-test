# Description
    This is backend of project that get primes in range of given value and calculate medium primes.
    
    For example
    if n = 10, the set of prime numbers less than 10 is [2, 3, 5, 7], and so the medians are [3, 5]
    If n = 18, the set of prime numbers less than 18 is [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17], and so the median is [7]
    
    I used the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to work in a realistic amount of time when n > 10,000
